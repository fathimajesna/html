        <p style="color:blue;font-size:25px;">The word Kerala is first recorded as Keralaputo in a 3rd-century-BCE rock inscription left by the Maurya emperor Ashoka (274â€“237 BCE), one of his edicts pertaining to welfare.[27] At that time, one of three states in the region was called Cheralam in Classical Tamil: Chera and Kera are variants of the same word.[28] The word Cheral refers to the oldest known dynasty of Kerala kings and is derived from the Proto-Tamil-Malayalam word for 'lake'.[29] Keralam may stem from the Classical Tamil cherive-alam 'declivity of a hill or a mountain slope'or chera alam 'land of the Cheras'.</p>
